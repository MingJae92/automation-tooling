Problem before

Pagination was handled manually with variables like current_page, has_prev, has_next, total_pages.

This caused skipped tasks and errors when pages > 0.

Template and views were tightly coupled with complex calculations.

Solution:

Use Django’s Paginator and pass page_obj from views.py.

Template now uses page_obj for pagination:

page_obj.has_previous / page_obj.has_next

page_obj.previous_page_number / page_obj.next_page_number

Loop through page_obj.paginator.page_range for page numbers.

No manual page calculations needed.

Reasons for optimisation:

Automatically slices tasks per page correctly.

Supports any number of tasks.

Correctly highlights the active page.

Cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain.
